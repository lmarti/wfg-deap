This repo is meant to test and illustrate our implementation of the WFG problems.

## IPython notebook example

We have prepare an IPython notebook to check our code. It may be also usefull as a example on how to use the WFG problems. Grab it here: https://github.com/lmarti/wfg-deap/blob/master/WFG%20Test.ipynb

## PR'ed to DEAP!

After we have tested that the problems are correctly implemented we have created a pull request for including `wfg.py` as part of [DEAP](http://github.com/deap/DEAP) guys.
